Robin’s really happy with how her web app—and her portfolio—turned out. After some thought, she has decided her web app needs a bit more…oomph. She would like to add high resolution images for each of Mars’ hemispheres (Links to an external site.). The quality of the images will bring an extra level of aesthetic appeal to her app.
